# Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store

### 1.1 Introduction
This project involves analyzing the sales performance of a retail store to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends. The objective is to create an interactive **Power BI** dashboard that highlights these findings, providing a visual representation of the store's sales data. 

The analysis was carried out in three main steps:
1. **Google Sheets**: I started by exploring the sales data using pivot tables to summarize total sales by product, region, and month. I also used formulas to calculate key metrics like average sales per product and total revenue by region.
2. **SQL**: Next, I used SQL queries to dive deeper into the data, extracting insights such as the highest-selling product, top 5 customers, and monthly sales totals.
3. **Power BI**: Finally, I visualized the findings in a Power BI dashboard, offering a user-friendly overview of sales performance, including breakdowns by product and region.

### 1.2 Tools Used
- **Google Sheets**: Used for data exploration, pivot tables, and basic summary analysis.
- **PostgreSQL**: Used to query the dataset for more detailed analysis and insights.
- **Power BI**: Used to create an interactive dashboard to visualize key metrics and trends.
- **Dataset**: A sales dataset containing information on sales transactions, customer details, and product information.

## SQL Queries Analysis
### 1.1 Objective
PostgreSQL was used to perform more advanced queries on the dataset, allowing us to extract insights that could not be easily calculated in Google Sheets. Below are some of the key questions answered using SQL queries and the insights they provided.

### 1.2 Methodology
-  Loaded the sales dataset into PostgreSQL and conducted initial queries to explore its structure, ensuring all necessary columns were present.
-  Employed SQL queries to calculate key metrics, including total sales and revenue, using functions like SUM, COUNT, and GROUP BY.
-  Applied date filtering with EXTRACT and DATE_TRUNC to focus on specific time periods, such as the current year and last quarter.
-  Utilized ORDER BY and LIMIT to rank products, regions, and customers based on performance indicators.
-  Implemented subqueries to identify products with no sales in the last quarter and calculate regional sales percentages.
-  Analyzed the data to derive actionable insights, highlighting top-performing products and areas for improvement.

### 1.3 Key Reports
#### 1.3.1 Total Sales for Each Product Category
```
SELECT product, SUM(quantity) AS total_units_sales
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY total_units_sales DESC;
```
- **Hat** is the top-selling product in terms of units sold, with a total of **15,929** units sold.
- **Shoes** is the second most sold product, with **14,402** units.
- **Shirt** and **Gloves** closely follow, with **12,388** units and **12,369** units, respectively.
- **Socks** and **Jacket** have the lowest sales, with **7,921** units and **5,452** units, respectively.
  
**Hat** and **Shoes** are the most popular products in terms of units sold, indicating strong demand for these items. **Shirt** and **Gloves** also perform well, making them valuable products to maintain in inventory. **Socks** and **Jackets** have the lowest unit sales, suggesting potential areas for improvement in marketing, pricing, or product promotion to increase their demand.

#### 1.3.2 Number of Sales Transactions in Each Region
```
SELECT region, COUNT(order_id) AS transaction_count
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY region;
```
- The **East** region recorded the highest number of transactions, with **2,483** sales transactions.
- The **North** and **South** regions followed closely, with **2,481** and **2,480** transactions, respectively.
- The **West** region had slightly fewer transactions, with **2,477** sales.
  
The data shows that all regions are performing similarly in terms of the number of sales transactions, with only slight variations. The close numbers across regions suggest that customer activity is consistent geographically, though focusing on specific strategies for **East** (the top performer) could yield further opportunities to enhance performance. The **West** region, while slightly behind, could still be an area to explore for optimization in terms of increasing the number of transactions.

#### 1.3.3 Highest-Selling Product by Total Sales Value
```
SELECT product, SUM(revenue) AS total_sales_value
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY total_sales_value DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
- The **Shoes** category generated the highest total sales value, with a revenue of **$613,380**.

**Shoes** is the top-performing product in terms of total sales value, indicating that it is not only popular in terms of units sold but also a key driver of overall revenue. The high sales value suggests that **Shoes** should remain a primary focus in both inventory management and marketing efforts to sustain or increase its contribution to total revenue.

#### 1.3.4 Total Revenue per Product
```
SELECT product, SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY product;
```
- **Shoes** generated the highest total revenue, bringing in **$613,380**.
- **Shirts** followed with total revenue of **$485,600**.
- **Hat** and **Gloves** generated **$316,195** and **$296,900**, respectively, making them mid-tier products in terms of revenue.
- **Socks** and **Jacket** had the lowest total revenue, with **$180,785** and **$208,230**, respectively.

**Shoes** and **Shirts** are the top revenue-generating products, confirming their high demand and strong contribution to the store's overall sales. Marketing and inventory management efforts should prioritize these items to maximize revenue. **Socks** and **Jackets**, on the other hand, are lower revenue performers. These products may benefit from strategic interventions such as pricing adjustments, improved marketing, or promotional efforts to increase their sales and revenue contribution.

#### 1.3.5 Monthly Sales Totals for the Current Year (2024)
```
SELECT TO_CHAR(order_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS month, 
       SUM(revenue) AS monthly_total_sales
FROM sales_data
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) = 2024
GROUP BY TO_CHAR(order_date, 'YYYY-MM')
ORDER BY month;
```
- **February** had the highest sales, generating **$298,800**, followed by **January** with **$198,400**.
- **August 2024** also performed well with **$174,300** in sales.
- The lowest sales were recorded in **July ($37,200)** and **April ($39,440)**.

**February** shows strong sales performance, potentially due to seasonality, promotions, or increased demand. This trend suggests that early-year months, especially January and February, are key periods for the store's revenue generation. The significant drop in sales during **March**, **April**, **May**, and **July** indicates a slower period for the store. This could be an opportunity to investigate the causes—such as market trends, product availability, or insufficient marketing—and strategize accordingly to boost sales in these months. **August** showed a rebound in sales, suggesting that mid-year promotions or campaigns could help sustain performance into the later months of the year.

#### 1.3.6 Top 5 Customers by Total Purchase Amount
```
SELECT customer_id, SUM(revenue) AS total_purchase_amount
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_purchase_amount DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
- The **top 5 customers**—Cus1049, Cus1133, Cus1493, Cus1251, and Cus1257—all contributed the same total purchase amount of **$4,235**.
- 
Given that the **top 5 customers** all contributed the same total purchase amount, this suggests a trend of similar purchasing behaviors or transaction sizes among high-value customers. These customers represent an important segment for retention efforts, and personalized loyalty programs or promotions could encourage repeat purchases and further strengthen their relationship with the business. Understanding why these customers have reached the top (e.g., frequent purchases, high transaction values, or specific product preferences) can help inform future strategies aimed at targeting similar customer profiles.

#### 1.3.7 Percentage of Total Sales Contributed by Each Region
```
SELECT region, SUM(revenue) AS region_sales,
       (SUM(revenue) / (SELECT SUM(revenue) FROM sales_data) * 100) AS sales_percentage
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY region;
```
- The **South** region contributed the highest percentage of total sales, with **44.16%** of the overall revenue (**$927,820**).
- The **East** region followed with **23.13%** of total sales, generating **$485,925**.
- The **North** and **West** regions contributed **18.42%** (**$387,000**) and **14.29%** (**$300,345**) of total sales, respectively.

The **South** region is the most significant contributor to total sales, accounting for nearly half of the revenue. This confirms the importance of continuing to focus marketing and sales efforts in this region to sustain growth. The **East** region also performs well, contributing over **23%** of total sales, making it a key region for further development. The lower contributions from the **North** and **West** regions suggest opportunities for expansion or improvement. Targeted strategies such as regional promotions, tailored product offerings, or customer engagement initiatives in these areas could help boost their sales percentages and overall contribution to total revenue.

#### 1.3.8 Products with No Sales in the Last Quarter
```
SELECT DISTINCT product
FROM sales_data
WHERE product NOT IN (
    SELECT product
    FROM sales_data
    WHERE order_date >= DATE_TRUNC('quarter', CURRENT_DATE) - INTERVAL '3 months'
);
```
- The following products recorded no sales in the last quarter: **Socks**, **Gloves**, **Shirt**, **Jacket**.

The lack of sales for **Socks**, **Gloves**, **Shirt**, and **Jacket** over the last quarter suggests these items may be falling out of demand or facing stock or marketing issues. Further investigation is required to determine the root cause. Actions such as running targeted promotions, adjusting pricing, or reviewing product availability can help revive sales for these items and prevent inventory from stagnating. Monitoring these products more closely in the next quarter could provide insights into whether the lack of sales is a temporary trend or indicative of a long-term decline in demand.

### 1.4 Conclusion
The SQL analysis provided valuable insights into the retail store's sales performance, highlighting critical trends in products, regions, and monthly sales.

Shoes were the top-selling product by units and revenue, while Jackets and Socks underperformed, signaling areas for improvement. The South region contributed nearly half of total sales, whereas the West region showed potential for growth with targeted marketing. February was the peak sales month, while April and July experienced lower sales, suggesting seasonality. 

Notably, several products, including Socks and Jackets, had no sales in the last quarter, which may reflect declining demand or other issues requiring further exploration.
