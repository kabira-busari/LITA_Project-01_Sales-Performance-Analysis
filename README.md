## Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store

### 1.1 Introduction
This project involves analyzing the sales performance of a retail store to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends. The objective is to create an interactive **Power BI** dashboard that highlights these findings, providing a visual representation of the store's sales data. 

The analysis was carried out in three main steps:
1. **Google Sheets**: I started by exploring the sales data using pivot tables to summarize total sales by product, region, and month. I also used formulas to calculate key metrics like average sales per product and total revenue by region.
2. **SQL**: Next, I used SQL queries to dive deeper into the data, extracting insights such as the highest-selling product, top 5 customers, and monthly sales totals.
3. **Power BI**: Finally, I visualized the findings in a Power BI dashboard, offering a user-friendly overview of sales performance, including breakdowns by product and region.

### 1.2 Tools Used
- **Google Sheets**: Used for data exploration, pivot tables, and basic summary analysis.
- **PostgreSQL**: Used to query the dataset for more detailed analysis and insights.
- **Power BI**: Used to create an interactive dashboard to visualize key metrics and trends.
- **Dataset**: A sales dataset containing information on sales transactions, customer details, and product information.
