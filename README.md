## Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store
This project involves analyzing the sales performance of a retail store to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends. The objective is to create an interactive **Power BI** dashboard that highlights these findings, providing a visual representation of the store's sales data. The analysis was carried out in three main steps:
1. **Excel**: I started by exploring the sales data using pivot tables to summarize total sales by product, region, and month. I also used formulas to calculate key metrics like average sales per product and total revenue by region.
2. **SQL**: Next, I used SQL queries to dive deeper into the data, extracting insights such as the highest-selling product, top 5 customers, and monthly sales totals.
3. **Power BI**: Finally, I visualized the findings in a Power BI dashboard, offering a user-friendly overview of sales performance, including breakdowns by product and region.

This project demonstrates how combining Excel, SQL, and Power BI can provide powerful insights into business performance, making it easier to make data-driven decisions.

### Deliverables:
- Excel files containing pivot tables and calculated metrics.
- SQL scripts for data extraction and analysis.
- Power BI dashboard showcasing the analyzed data.

### How to Use:
- Navigate to the Excel folder for sales data exploration.
- Access the SQL folder for analysis scripts.
- Visit the Power BI folder for the interactive dashboard.
- Review this overview for a clear understanding of the project objectives and structure.

### Installation/Setup
To reproduce the analysis, you’ll need the following tools and software:
#### Prerequisites:
- **Microsoft Excel**: For the initial exploration of sales data.
- **SQL Server**: To run SQL queries on the dataset.
- **Power BI**: To visualize the insights and create the final interactive dashboard.
#### Dataset:
You can download the sales dataset from [Dataset Source](#) or use any available retail sales dataset for practice.
### Step-by-Step Setup:
1. **Excel**:
   - Open the sales dataset in Excel.
   - Explore the data using pivot tables and formulas (details provided in the next section).
2. **SQL**:
   - Import the dataset into **SQL Server**.
     - Ensure SQL Server is properly installed on your machine.
     - Create a new database and load the dataset into a table.
   - You’ll use SQL queries to extract deeper insights from the data (SQL query examples provided later).
3. **Power BI**:
   - Connect Power BI to your SQL database or import the Excel file directly into Power BI.
   - Create your dashboard by visualizing the insights (details covered in the Power BI section).

With this setup, you’ll be able to explore, analyze, and visualize the sales data as described in the following sections.
