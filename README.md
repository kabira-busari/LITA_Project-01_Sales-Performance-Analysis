# Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store

### 1.1 Introduction
This project involves analyzing the sales performance of a retail store to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends. The objective is to create an interactive **Power BI** dashboard that highlights these findings, providing a visual representation of the store's sales data. 

The analysis was carried out in three main steps:
1. **Google Sheets**: I started by exploring the sales data using pivot tables to summarize total sales by product, region, and month. I also used formulas to calculate key metrics like average sales per product and total revenue by region.
2. **SQL**: Next, I used SQL queries to dive deeper into the data, extracting insights such as the highest-selling product, top 5 customers, and monthly sales totals.
3. **Power BI**: Finally, I visualized the findings in a Power BI dashboard, offering a user-friendly overview of sales performance, including breakdowns by product and region.

### 1.2 Tools Used
- **Google Sheets**: Used for data exploration, pivot tables, and basic summary analysis.
- **PostgreSQL**: Used to query the dataset for more detailed analysis and insights.
- **Power BI**: Used to create an interactive dashboard to visualize key metrics and trends.
- **Dataset**: A sales dataset containing information on sales transactions, customer details, and product information.

## Google Sheets Analysis
### 1.1 Objective
The Google Sheets analysis was conducted to explore sales data and generate key insights using pivot tables, charts, and formulas. The analysis focused on understanding product performance, regional sales, monthly sales trends, average sales per product, and average sales per region.

### 1.2 Methodology
1. **Data Loading**: Imported the sales data into Google Sheets and clean it.
2. **Pivot Tables**:
   - Created pivot tables to summarize total sales by product, region, and month.
   - Summarized total revenue by region and identified monthly sales trends.
3. **Formulas**:
   - Calculated total sales by product, total revenue by region, and average sales per product.

## SQL Queries Analysis
### 1.1 Objective
PostgreSQL was used to perform more advanced queries on the dataset, allowing us to extract insights that could not be easily calculated in Google Sheets. Below are some of the key questions answered using SQL queries and the insights they provided.

### 1.2 Methodology

### 1.3 Key Reports
#### 1.3.1 Total Sales for Each Product Category
```
SELECT product, SUM(quantity) AS total_units_sales
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY total_units_sales DESC;
```
- Hat is the top-selling product in terms of units sold, with a total of 15,929 units sold.
- Shoes is the second most sold product, with 14,402 units.
- Shirt and Gloves closely follow, with 12,388 units and 12,369 units, respectively.
- Socks and Jacket have the lowest sales, with 7,921 units and 5,452 units, respectively.
Hat and Shoes are the most popular products in terms of units sold, indicating strong demand for these items. Shirt and Gloves also perform well, making them valuable products to maintain in inventory. Socks and Jackets have the lowest unit sales, suggesting potential areas for improvement in marketing, pricing, or product promotion to increase their demand.

#### 1.3.2 Number of Sales Transactions in Each Region
```
SELECT region, COUNT(order_id) AS transaction_count
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY region;
```
- The East region recorded the highest number of transactions, with 2,483 sales transactions.
- The North and South regions followed closely, with 2,481 and 2,480 transactions, respectively.
- The West region had slightly fewer transactions, with 2,477 sales.
The data shows that all regions are performing similarly in terms of the number of sales transactions, with only slight variations. The close numbers across regions suggest that customer activity is consistent geographically, though focusing on specific strategies for East (the top performer) could yield further opportunities to enhance performance. The West region, while slightly behind, could still be an area to explore for optimization in terms of increasing the number of transactions.
