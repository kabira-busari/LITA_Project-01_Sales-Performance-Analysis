# Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store

### 1.1 Introduction
This project involves analyzing the sales performance of a retail store to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends. The objective is to create an interactive **Power BI** dashboard that highlights these findings, providing a visual representation of the store's sales data. 

The analysis was carried out in three main steps:
1. **Google Sheets**: I started by exploring the sales data using pivot tables to summarize total sales by product, region, and month. I also used formulas to calculate key metrics like average sales per product and total revenue by region.
2. **SQL**: Next, I used SQL queries to dive deeper into the data, extracting insights such as the highest-selling product, top 5 customers, and monthly sales totals.
3. **Power BI**: Finally, I visualized the findings in a Power BI dashboard, offering a user-friendly overview of sales performance, including breakdowns by product and region.

### 1.2 Tools Used
- **Google Sheets**: Used for data exploration, pivot tables, and basic summary analysis.
- **PostgreSQL**: Used to query the dataset for more detailed analysis and insights.
- **Power BI**: Used to create an interactive dashboard to visualize key metrics and trends.
- **Dataset**: A sales dataset containing information on sales transactions, customer details, and product information.

## Google Sheets Analysis
### 1.1 Objective
The Google Sheets analysis was conducted to explore sales data and generate key insights using pivot tables, charts, and formulas. The analysis focused on understanding product performance, regional sales, monthly sales trends, and average sales per product.

### 1.2 Methodology
1. **Data Loading**: Imported the sales data into Google Sheets.
2. **Pivot Tables**:
   - Created pivot tables to summarize total sales by product, region, and month.
   - Summarized total revenue by region and identified monthly sales trends.
3. **Formulas**:
   - Calculated total sales by product, total revenue by region, and average sales per product.
  
### 1.3 Key Reports

#### 1.3.1 Total Sales by Product

**Key Findings and Interpretation**

This report summarizes the total revenue generated by each product, helping to identify which products contribute the most to the company’s sales. The analysis revealed that **Shoes** was the top-selling product, generating **$613,380**, which accounts for approximately **29.2%** of the overall revenue. This indicates that shoes are in high demand and a major contributor to the store's sales. **Shirt** followed closely behind with **$485,600** in revenue, contributing **23.1%** to total sales, showcasing strong performance as well.

Other products, such as **Gloves** and **Hat**, generated **$296,900** and **$316,195**, respectively, making them mid-tier products in terms of sales. These items contributed around **14.1%** and **15.0%** of the total revenue, respectively, indicating solid performance but not as high as Shoes and Shirts.

The products with the lowest sales were **Jacket** and **Socks**, with revenue figures of **$208,230** and **$180,785**, contributing **9.9%** and **8.6%** to total sales, respectively. These lower figures suggest there may be opportunities to improve the sales of these products, possibly through more targeted marketing or adjusted pricing strategies.


#### 1.3.2 Total Sales by Region

**Key Findings and Interpretation**

This report outlines the revenue generated from each region, allowing us to understand which geographical areas are performing the best in terms of sales. The analysis reveals that the **South** region generated the highest total sales with **$927,820**, accounting for a significant portion of the overall revenue. The **East** and **North** regions also contributed notably, with **$485,925** and **$387,000**, respectively. In contrast, the **West** region recorded the lowest sales at **$300,345**.

This indicates that the **South** region is a strong performer, likely due to a combination of factors such as higher customer demand, better product availability, or effective marketing. The **East** and **North** regions, though still performing reasonably well, lag behind the **South**. **West** has the lowest total sales, suggesting potential areas for improvement, such as enhancing product visibility, improving regional marketing strategies, or boosting customer engagement efforts in that region.


#### 1.3.3 Monthly Sales Trends

**Key Findings and Interpretation**

A pivot table was used to analyze the store's monthly sales trends throughout the year, helping to track how revenue fluctuated over time. The analysis showed that **February 2023** was the peak sales month, generating **$546,300**, which significantly outperformed all other months. This could be attributed to factors such as promotions, seasonal demand, or other external influences that drove a high volume of sales during this period.

Following **February**, **July** recorded strong sales with **$274,800**, and **June** closely followed with **$247,600**. These months suggest that the store performs well in the middle of the year, possibly due to seasonal trends or customer purchasing behaviors during that time.

In contrast, **April** and **September** were the weakest months in terms of sales, with revenues of **$46,865** and **$34,720**, respectively. These significant drops in revenue may indicate slower business periods, and further investigation might be necessary to understand the reasons behind the low sales performance during these months. Factors such as product availability, lack of promotions, or market conditions could have contributed to the underperformance.


#### 1.3.4 Average Sales per Product



**Key Findings and Interpretation**

This metric calculates the average sales amount per transaction for each product, providing insights into how well each product performs on a per-sale basis. The analysis reveals that the **Shirt** has the highest average sales per transaction at **$326.56**, followed closely by **Shoes** with an average of **$308.70**. These figures indicate that both products are not only top performers in total sales but also represent high-value items in the store.

In contrast, **Socks** recorded the lowest average sales at **$121.82**, suggesting that they may be lower-value products with smaller transaction amounts. Other products, such as **Gloves**, **Hat**, and **Jacket**, show average sales ranging from **$139.94** to **$200.07**, indicating moderate performance.

The strong performance of **Shirt** and **Shoes** suggests that these items could be prioritized in marketing and inventory strategies to maximize revenue. Conversely, the lower average sales of **Socks** point to potential opportunities for reevaluation in pricing or marketing approaches to enhance their sales performance.



6. **Average Revenue by Region**
This report is similar to the previous "Total Sales by Region" pivot table but is included here for completeness.

### 1.4 Insights
1. **Product Performance**: Shoes and Shirts are the top performers both in terms of total sales and average sales per transaction. This suggests that these products not only sell well but also generate significant revenue with each sale.

2. **Regional Performance**: The South region is the most profitable, contributing nearly half of the company’s total revenue. Targeted marketing or further investments in this region could be beneficial, while strategies to improve sales in the West region may also be worth considering.
   
3. **Seasonal Trends**: The early months of the year (particularly February) showed a spike in sales, while sales dropped off significantly during the middle of the year (April and September). This information could help in planning inventory or marketing campaigns for future months.

### 1.5 Conclusion
The analysis of sales data conducted using Google Sheets yielded valuable insights into product performance, contributions from different regions, and monthly sales trends. The findings revealed that Shoes and Shirts emerged as the top products, excelling in both total and average sales. Additionally, it was noted that the South region significantly outperformed others in terms of sales, whereas the West region showed a need for improvement. Furthermore, February was identified as a critical month for sales, while September recorded the lowest revenue, suggesting potential seasonal effects. These insights can inform strategic decisions regarding inventory management and marketing efforts.
